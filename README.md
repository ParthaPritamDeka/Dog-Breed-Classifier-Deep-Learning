## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Dog Breed Classifier Project! In this project, we learnt to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, our algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we made important design decisions about the user experience for our app.Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Our imperfect solution nonetheless creates a fun user experience!
